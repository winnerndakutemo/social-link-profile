### The challenge

I found difficult centering the div and it was difficult to manage content's width.
I've made 3 months without coding any project so it has taken me 2 hour to realise the project.

### My processs

I started by creating base html5 marckups and then realise css.
I was just looking at the design file(design.png not the .sketch) so I've done my own judgement about
size and fonts.
I didn't use a great code arragement for css file cuz like I told you, It's didn't code for 3 months and
it's really difficult to think about good code-styles.
I didn't use git but I will push my project for saving it.

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- CSS flexbox
- CSS variables
